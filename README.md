*In this project we were assigned to re-impliment the Bourn Again Shell (BASH)*

### This shell should:
- Display diplay a prompt and wait for user to type a command. A command line always end with a newline.
- The command lines are simple no semicolons no pipes no redirections or any other advanced features.
- The command lines are only made of one lines. No urguments will be passed to the programs.
- If an exutable can not be found it will print an arror message and display the prompt again.
- Handle arrors.
- It will aslo handle "End of file" condition (cntrl+D)

### This Shell does not:
- Use the *PATH*.
- Impliment build-ins.
- Handle special charactors: ", ', `, \\, *, &, #.
- Move the cursor.
- Handle commands with arguments.
